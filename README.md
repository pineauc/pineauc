# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!
### I love coding. When it comes to what you can build, your imagination is the limit.

As of late, I've been doing a lot of automation. Working with scripting languages like Bash, PowerShell, and Python. On top of this, I've been studying full-stack web development. I'm not going to lie, it's a lot of information to ingest all at once, but I really enjoy the learning process and the challenges that come with it.

One of my current goals is to become a DevOps Engineer...

> _"Let's see that 3-5 years of experience, bud."_

While I haven't had my big break yet, I've been keeping the position on my radar because it aligns with a lot of my current hobbies:

 - Internet of Things (IoT)
 - Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
 - Scripting & Automation
 - Network Administration

Here's to a new beginning, the start of something fresh and challenging! Stick around if you'd like to see the journey unfold.

Thanks for looking! ðŸ‘€
